# INSAlgo trainings 2020
INSAlgo 2020-2021 lectures and exercises of our weekly sessions. For your own good, don't read the solution to problems you haven't tried to solve yet.

You can propose your own solutions for missing or improvable ones !

Most slides are inspired by 2018 lectures by [Louis Sugy/Nyrio](https://github.com/Nyrio), credits to him !
