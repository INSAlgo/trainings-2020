# Week 19 : Genetic Traveling salesman problem



## Intro

This week's training is based on a famous algorithmic problem, the *traveling* (or travelling :uk: ) *salesman problem* !
Being an NP-hard problem, there exists no algorithm to find the optimal solution to this problem in the general case that can terminate in a decent execution time when there are more than a few cities (or vertices) in the problem.
However, there are many techniques that we can use to approximate the optimal solution to this problem in a reasonable execution time, and the one we will use this week is a *genetic algorithm* !

If you attended the previous training, you should already know about it; if that's not the case, check week 18's presentation !



## Your job now

Find the exercise's code and its documentation in the [gap-fill-code](gap-fill-code/) folder (both taken from [the original repository](https://github.com/eneiss/Genetic-TSP-Python)'s `gap-fill` branch), then fill in the gaps and see what your solution can do !

You can use [today's slideshow](genetic_tsp_slides.pdf) for an introduction to the problem and for a quick walkthrough of the code.
